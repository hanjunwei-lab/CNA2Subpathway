Description: Identification of dysregulated subpathway driven by Copy Number Aberrations(CNA).We first integrated CNA and gene expression data to calculate CNADEscore for each gene in cancer.Secondly,we construct a subpathway network based on the biological function relationship between subpathways,and the weight of this network regulated by the CNADEscore.Finally,we use an eigenvector centrality measure to determine the significance of a subpathway,and the statistical significance of these subpathways is assessed using a bootstrap-based randomization method.
