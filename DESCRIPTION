Description: Identify dysfunctional subpathways driven by somatic copy number alterations (CNAs). we first construct a weighted subpathway crosstalk network. the weights of the network consider both the crosstalk relationship of the biological functions performed among those subpathways and the differential expression extent of genes influenced by the CNAs. Next, we calculate the centrality scores of subpathways by a random walk algorithm on the network, which reflect the extent of subpathways influenced by the somatic CNAs and subpathways crosstalk. Finally, a bootstrap-based randomization method is used to calculate the statistical significance of the scores.
