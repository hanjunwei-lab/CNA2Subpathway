# CNA2Subpathway

## A software R package for identification of dysfunctional subpathways driven by somatic Copy Number Alterations

### A computing tool is developed to identify dysfunctional subpathways driven by somatic copy number alterations (CNAs) in cancer through integrating multi-omics data, pathway topology information, and subpathway crosstalk network. The operation modes including: i) discretize the CNAs profile based on the CNAs status to a binary matrix. ii) evaluation the gene differentially expressed level between CNA labels. iii) construct a weighted subpathway crosstalk network, calculate the centrality scores of subpathways by a random walk algorithm and a bootstrap-based randomization method is used to identify statistical significance dysregulated subpathways driven by CNAs in cancer.
